# infoto
a script to automate generating your jpeg photo with a border and the specified metadata in text below the image

Very much WIP

script requires 2 arguments.
```bash
$ ./main.py <image-file> <info.json>
```

A `metadata.json` file has been included to show an example of the required input for the `info.json` argument.
Currently only support JPEG images.

You will need to download a TTF font file to work with this script. You can find some to download at these two links:
